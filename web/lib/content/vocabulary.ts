/**
 * vocabulary.ts — shared, locale-aware product vocabulary for codewhale.net.
 *
 * This module is the single source of truth for the exact product nouns a new
 * user meets on the site: the Fleet/Workflow/Lane/Runtime execution nouns,
 * the Plan/Act/Operate + Ask/Auto-Review/Full Access control vocabulary, the
 * public Consultant role, and the fields that make route provenance legible.
 *
 * TRUTH CONTRACT:
 *   - `short.en` for every product term MUST equal the verbatim definition in
 *     docs/public-surface-facts.json → product.terminology, which is itself
 *     pinned verbatim against docs/FLEET.md by public-surface-contract.test.ts.
 *   - Mode and posture names MUST equal matrix.control.modes /
 *     matrix.control.permissionPostures (pinned against docs/MODES.md).
 *   - No marketing adjectives. Each description states behavior and boundary.
 *
 * EXTENSION PATH FOR NEW LOCALES (localization lane):
 *   Every user-facing string is a `{ en, zh }` pair. Add the new locale key to
 *   each pair (and widen the `LocalizedText` type) — the consuming components
 *   and tests pick it up without structural changes. The tests assert key
 *   parity across locales, so a missing translation fails deterministically.
