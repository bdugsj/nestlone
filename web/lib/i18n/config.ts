/**
 * Locale configuration for codewhale.net.
 *
 * This is the single canonical website locale registry — the locale
 * switcher, Next.js route generation, middleware detection, sitemap, and
 * hreflang alternates all derive from `ALL_LOCALES`. The cross-surface
 * matrix (TUI packs, READMEs, website) lives in docs/LOCALIZATION.md.
 *
 * Status semantics:
 * - `shipped`  — full website parity with English on first-class pages.
 * - `partial`  — routed and selectable, but intentionally incomplete:
 *                chrome (nav/footer/switcher), the home page, and metadata
 *                are localized via web/lib/i18n/dictionaries/<code>/ and
 *                everything else falls back to English. The switcher marks
 *                these with a visible partial badge. No route 404s and no
 *                untranslated string ever renders a dictionary key.
 * - `planned`  — tracked in docs/LOCALIZATION.md with a target issue; not
 *                routed.
 * - `deferred` — acknowledged but not scheduled; not routed.
 *
 * When adding a locale:
 * 1. Add/flip the entry in `ALL_LOCALES` below.
 * 2. Scaffold dictionaries under web/lib/i18n/dictionaries/<code>/
 *    (chrome.ts + home.ts — see dictionaries/en/ for the reference shape).
 * 3. Run `npm run check:locales` (dictionary key parity) and `npm test`.
 * 4. Update docs/LOCALIZATION.md.
